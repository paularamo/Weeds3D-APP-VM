# ANALYZE CREATED POINT CLOUD CLUSTERS 

## ReadBundleOut.py

Analyse using bundle_20.out files in each cluster. The files are parsed into dictionaries to make it more readable and the information is used to bring all clusters to one scale as well as assign classes based on segmentation maps. 

## ReadPMVS.py

Analyze using Open3D and the dense point clouds generated by the PMVS algorithm. A combined point clouds is generated using Multiway registration in Open3D. Can be used to visualize the combined point clouds. 

The Jupyter notebook was used for experimental purposes for making the dictionary from bundle.out files.
